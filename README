The Twenty-First Century Amateur Radio Project: Peaberry SDR

The project was built with PSoC Creator 2.0 (available free, as in beer):

It is normal to get errors about missing files until you have built
the project for the first time.  This is because the generated files
have been excluded from the git repository.

This is a work in progress.  If you build the hardware today then you'll
have to wait for finished PSoC code before the device is useful.
